# My-Firts-CRUD-with-ASP.NET-Core-MVC-with-C-.NET-6-in-SQL-Server

there are some things you should know:

1 - for your SQL SERVER to be accepted in the CRUD you must have a table with the same capabilities as mine, unless you make the pertinent changes.

2 - The connection string is configured in the appsettings.json section, specifically in the part where it says;

     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "SqlServerConection": "Server=;Database=CRUD; integrated security=true; User Id=;Password=;Encrypt=false;"
     }
